# XmlComparer

This is a simple tool that can compare two XML files and produce a friendly HTML output showing differences between these XMLs (just like WinMerge does). It is expected that these two HTML-formatted strings can be shown on neighbor 'div' elements. The difference between these files is highlighted by 'span' elements which are configured by HtmlSpanStart and HtmlEndSpan strings.
